# Wine Classification with PCA and k-NN

This project uses PCA and GridSearchCV-optimized k-Nearest Neighbors for classifying wines from the UCI Wine dataset.

## Highlights
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Tuned k-NN hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Achieved 96% classification accuracy
- Visualized clusters and confusion matrix

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GridSearchCV

## Dataset
This project uses historical MLB team data from the [Baseball Databank on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielmontilla/baseball-databank).  
Please download the dataset manually and place `Teams.csv` in your local `data/` folder before running the notebook.
