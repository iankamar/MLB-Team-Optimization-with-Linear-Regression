# Wine Classification with PCA and k-NN

This project uses PCA and GridSearchCV-optimized k-Nearest Neighbors for classifying wines from the UCI Wine dataset.

## Highlights
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- Tuned k-NN hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
- Achieved 96% classification accuracy
- Visualized clusters and confusion matrix

## Technologies
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GridSearchCV
